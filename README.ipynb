Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon whereby a customer leaves a product or service. Understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is a key business concern, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThe project involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the dataset and explore its features and values to gain an understanding of the data.\n\n2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers, and preprocess it by normalizing numerical values and encoding categorical ones.\n\n3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform an in-depth analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between features.\n\n4. **Model Building:** Build a predictive model to predict customer churn. This could involve various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.\n\n5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.\n\n6. **Model Optimization:** Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters and using techniques such as cross-validation.\n\n7. **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide business insights and recommendations based on the model's findings.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe dataset used in this project contains information about customers of a telecommunications company. The features include demographic information (such as age and gender), services used, account information, and whether or not the customer has churned.\n\n## Tools\n\nThis project uses Python and its libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment.",
