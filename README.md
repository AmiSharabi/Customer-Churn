Customer Churn Analysis
This project is focused on the analysis of customer churn. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon whereby a customer leaves a product or service. Understanding the factors that contribute to customer churn is a key business concern, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and explore its features and values to gain an understanding of the data.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers, and preprocess it by normalizing numerical values and encoding categorical ones.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform an in-depth analysis of the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between features.

Model Building: Build a predictive model to predict customer churn. This could involve various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curves.

Model Optimization: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters and using techniques such as cross-validation.

Insights and Recommendations: Provide business insights and recommendations based on the model's findings.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about customers of a telecommunications company. The features include demographic information (such as age and gender), services used, account information, and whether or not the customer has churned.

Tools
This project uses Python and its libraries for data analysis and machine learning, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment.
